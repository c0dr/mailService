# ðŸ“§ mailService

This is a simple PoC application to send emails without any hassle. It is written in Kotlin.

The templates are written in MJML (a framework that makes writing emails easy).
To bring logic and data in the emails, Thymeleaf is used.
The MJML.io API is used to convert the populated MJML templates to HTML.
Postmark is used to send them out.
